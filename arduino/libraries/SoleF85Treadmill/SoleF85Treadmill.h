// Per the specs on the ROB-09064 servo from Sparkfun, it takes 200ms to rotate 60deg at
// 4.8V of power. These servos should be getting 5V of power, but let's use the 4.8V timing
// data to be on the safe side and figure that each degree of rotation takes 5.56 ms (rounding
// to 6ms). In practise, it was necessary to double this value from 6ms to 12ms.
//
// NOTE: Tweak these as needed to match your servos and the position of your servo arms relative to their

// moving to any target angle.
